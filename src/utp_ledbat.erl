%% @doc LEDBAT calculations
%%
%% == Overview ==
%% The code in this module maintains a LEDBAT calculation based upon
%% delay samples. A sample is the difference between two clocks, A and
%% B which we assume are moving onwards at the same speed, though we
%% do account for skew.
%%
%% The difference between our and their clock (A and B) is our base
%% delay. Any deviation from this difference in the positive direction
%% means we have a queuing delay of that amount. A deviation in the
%% negative direction means that we have to update our base delay to
%% the new value.
%%
%% == Base Delay and Current Delay ==
%% When we take in samples, we store these samples historically. This
%% is done such that small perturbances in the delay will not affect
%% the greater scheme of things. We track two kinds of delays: The
%% base history and the current (queue) history. Every minute, we
%% update and rotate the history tables so we never latch onto a
%% simplified view of the real world.

%% @doc Shift the base delay by an `Offset' amount.  Note that
%% shifting by a positive value moves the base delay such that the
%% queueing delay gets smaller. This is used in several spots to
%% account for the fact that we just realized our queueing delay is
%% too large. To make it smaller we shift the base delay up, which
%% affects the queueing delay down.
